## Build with HTML, CSS and javascript

## This game helped me a lot to improve some of my coding skills and some personal skills like:

* Develop logic and strategic thinking.
* positive attitude towards challenging tasks.
* Inspire imagination
* Deeper application of grid display, and how <br/>
to use parentElement, and siblingElements.
* Deeper learning of Math.floor(Math.random()*number).
